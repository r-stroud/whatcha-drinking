Whatcha Drinking is a CRUD web application to allow users to show off what new drink they have discovered and find new drinks through posts from other uses or by searching the available colleciton. Users can update and keep track of their current drink and how the number of times they have tried each drink, post about drinks they have tried, edit preferences to alter what drinks are displayed, preview other users profiles and send friend reqeusts, and more!

This project was created as a Final Capstone project while attending Nashville Software School's Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp.

## Project Description

I always love a good recommendation, especially when that recommendation is a drink recommendation! However, when recommendations are in abundance and life keeps you busy, it is very easy to lose track of what was recommended. This application is to make finding the perfect drink recommendation easy and fun. 

## Technologies Used

- .NET
- C#
- CSS
- React
- React-Router NPM
- SQL
- Victory NPM

## Project Goals

This capstone project focus was to include all of the skills I had learned over the front end and back end portions at NSS. I also wanted to implement firebase as I had yet to work that into a project myself and inlcude as much interactive features to keep the user engaged, such as the drag and drop features on the edit profile view.

## Project Challenges

There were several challenges that faced throughout the completion of this project. Implementing firebase authorization was a big accomplishment and I was really happy that I was able to pull that off. Another challenge was the drag and drop section. I had issues communication the correct target Id I wanted to update and required a bit of rework on both the front end and back end to get the issue resolved. Other key challenges worth mentioning are coding all the CSS without frameworks with the exception of an npm package for the graphs on the user profile view, validating if a user has registered with the app if clicking sign in with google and bringing them to the registration page if they are not, and the back end for the friend requests.

## Future Updates

I feel very happy with how this project turned out, but there is still a lot more I want to achieve with it!

Here a just a few of the features I would still like to implement:
- Comment section on posts
- Trending feature
- like / favorite buttons on posts and drinks
- rate drinks and show the signed in user vs total user ratings
- message between users
- drink queue for drinks user wants to try in the future
- recommendation button to recommend a specific drink to a specific user
